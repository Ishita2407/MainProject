# Models Used
Random Forest: An ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training.
XGBoost: An optimized gradient boosting library designed to be highly efficient and flexible.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies samples based on the majority class among the k-nearest neighbors.
Neural Network: A deep learning model capable of capturing complex patterns in data through multiple layers of interconnected neurons.
